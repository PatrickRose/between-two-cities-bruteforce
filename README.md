# Between Two Cities BruteForcer #

When playing a game of the delightful [Between Two Cities](http://stonemaiergames.com/games/between-two-cities/), we had the interesting question of "What's the highest score possible?". This is an attempt to work that out.

At the end of Between Two Cities, you'll have a 4x4 grid of tiles. There are 8 different tile types (Shops, Factories, 4 different types of Taverns, Offices, Parks and Houses). That gives 8^16 different options (281474976710656). This is just about bruteforceable.
